# 🧠 Ollama Local Chatbot  
### 🎯 Run LLMs Locally with Python Terminal Interface 🚀


## 👋 Introduction

A lightweight, terminal-based chatbot built in Python that connects directly with locally hosted LLMs using the [Ollama](https://ollama.com) API. No internet required after model download — perfect for offline experiments and fast prototyping.

## 📸 Screenshots

⚠️ Note: Apologies for the image quality. Due to hardware limitations on my personal system, I was unable to run the model locally. The screenshots were taken using a college lab machine where the setup was successful.
